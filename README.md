# HARUKI-group-practice
Group-practice assignment by @Haruki 
Dimi, Shiva, Wendy, Victor

## Why?
This assignment was given to us very shortly after we started our course at BeCode.
We have been racing trough: Github, The Git, Learned how to make a repository, Create a page on our own
by using what we have lurned so far:
- HTML 
- Css 
- Bootstrap 
- Progressive Enchancement 
- Sass

So now it was time to pass the final HTML/CSS Test and step it up by
* Learning to work in group and work with branches.
* Learning to complete a project, so it can be delivered to a client.

## What?
We Invented a company called Haruki and all agreed this would be a group practice which his kind oh a holistic approach. 
We thought of pages this company might need. The pages were divided so that each person would have to design a page.
In the end, all pages were joined together to result in a complete, fully functioning
website, ready to be delivered to a client (except for some more changes to be made).

It all sounds pretty simple, but let me tell you, we sure had our necessary struggles along the way. 

## The Project
We created a company called Haruki Group Practice.
The home-page speaks for itself:
